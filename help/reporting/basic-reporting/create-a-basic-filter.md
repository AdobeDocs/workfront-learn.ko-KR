# 기본 필터 만들기

This video explains how to create and use filters in Workfront to customize list reports based on specific criteria. &#x200B; Filters allow users to narrow down lists, such as tasks, projects, or documents, by defining conditions. &#x200B; Only items matching the filter conditions and accessible to the logged-in user will appear in the list. &#x200B;

## 핵심 사항

* **Filters Customize List Reports:** Filters in Workfront allow users to narrow down lists (tasks, projects, documents, etc.) based on specific criteria, showing only items that match the conditions and are accessible to the logged-in user. &#x200B;
* **Common Filter Types:** Examples include user-based filters like &quot;My Projects&quot; (showing projects specific to the logged-in user) and date-based filters like &quot;Due this month&quot; (showing items with planned completion dates within the current month). &#x200B;
* **Building Filters:** Filters are created using rules, such as &quot;AND&quot; filters (all conditions must be true) or &quot;OR&quot; filters (any condition can be true). &#x200B; For example, the &quot;My Completed Tasks&quot; filter combines rules for completed tasks and tasks assigned to the logged-in user. &#x200B;
* **Sharing and Removing Filters:** Filters can be shared with other Workfront users or removed via the filter menu, making them flexible and collaborative tools. &#x200B;
* **Clear Naming Practices:** Using &quot;My&quot; or &quot;I&quot; in filter names helps users understand that the filter results are specific to them, enhancing clarity and usability. &#x200B;
